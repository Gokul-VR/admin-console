## üñåÔ∏è Theming & Customization
- **Theme Toggle**: Go to the **Settings** page to switch between light and dark mode.
- **Primary/Secondary Colors**: Use the color pickers in Settings to instantly update the dashboard's accent colors.
- **All components** (buttons, toggles, sidebar, header, etc.) update automatically to match your theme and color choices.

### How Theming Works
- Uses CSS variables and Tailwind's `dark` mode.
- The `.dark` class is toggled on `<html>` for dark mode.
- Theme and color choices are stored in `localStorage`.
- All colors are referenced via CSS variables (e.g., `--primary-color`, `--secondary-color`).

## üõ†Ô∏è Customization
- Add new pages in `src/pages/` and link them in the sidebar.
- Create new components in `src/components/` and use theme classes (`bg-card`, `text-foreground`, etc.) for instant theming.
- Adjust theme variables in `index.css` for advanced color customization.
